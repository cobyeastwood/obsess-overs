# Obsess Overs

### Description
Obsess Overs is a side project to help others best <em>organize, sort, and manage favorite leftover home ingredients</em>. I built this as a cool idea to work with leftover ingredients at home. 
<br/>

For testing you will need to upload two large Kaggle datasets <strong>RAW_recipes.csv</strong> and <strong>RAW_interactions.csv</strong> from [Food.com Recipes and Interactions](https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions) into Postgres.

### Overview
As a brief overview, this project includes:

- React and Go routing
- Password hashing / login / logout
- File uploading / image processing / SMS
- Postgres and Redis drivers
- SQL queries, insertions and deletions

In addition, I added a cool ORC feature for allowing users to extract food items from uploaded receipts to their pantry to store new ingredients and manage their existing leftovers to pick the best-suited recipes.

In the future, I would like to add expiring date notifications and tags for food items as they are placed in the users' pantry. I also, want to allow users to upload new recipes both privately and publicly.

### Technologies
Frontend includes React and Redux. Backend was built with Go libraries [gin-gonic](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin), [gosseract](https://github.com/otiai10/gosseract) and Redis/Postgres as databases.
